### ðŸ’¾ Saving Nmap Output as HTML

 - `xsltproc scan.xml -o scan.html `

  - [TCP ACK scan](https://github.com/deepthiii33/Elavate_Labs_task-1/blob/main/screenshots/nmap_ack_scan.png)

  - Scan Type: TCP ACK scan.
  - nmap -sA 192.168.1.0/24: Performs a TCP ACK scan on the local network.
  - -oX scan.xml: Saves the scan results in XML format.
  - xsltproc (XSLT processor for transforming XML files) - Which converts the XML Nmap output (scan.xml) into a readable HTML file (scan.html).

  - Now we cam open scan.html in any browser (like Firefox or Chrome) to view the scan results in a nicely formatted way.
